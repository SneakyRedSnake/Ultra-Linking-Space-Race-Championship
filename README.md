# Ultra Linking Space Race Championship

## Principles

  ULSRC is a couch game between 4 different players. Each player has another player as a companion, and they are linked together with a laser rope. If a player hit a laser or a comet, he/she respawns at the beginning, and all the links switch.
  
## Context
  ULSRC is a challenge : we dev this game in a week, around the them "Universe" (we click on the "random page" of wikipedia and click on the 5 first link on the wikipedia page to choose this theme).
